# pyMaple
pyMaple is a simple 2D shooter game that was inspired by a popular MMORPG known as MapleStory. The game utilizes sprites and sounds extracted from the game itself. pyMaple is written in Python (as you could imagine from the name). It was a project that I did in my grade 11 year and showed steps into programming.

# Dependencies
There are a few requirements needed to get this code running:
- Python 2.7.3
- Pygame 1.9.1
With any other versions of Python and pygame, I cannot guarantee that it'll work as the code was not written for any other versions.

Controls for the game:
Arrow keys for movement. Left CTRL to attack.

# Side notes:
As with most games, there are always bugs.


1) Updating the monster movement when the player attacks a rapid pace (so to say, tapping attacks at a very fast pace).


2) When you attack, you'll stay in your last attack frame rather than a standing frame. This isn't a huge problem, but it is a problem visually and it shouldn't do that.
